# Data_analysis_using_covid19_data_Tableau
This is the simple demonstration of how we can create different and interesting charts, visuals and dashboards from same data.

The following questions we asked and then created visuals from Covid-19 Dataset.

1. What are the total number of Confirmed cases in different nations?
2. What are the total number of Recovered cases in different nations?
3. What are the total number of Confirmed cases in India?
4. What are the total number of Recovered cases in India?
5. Can we Forecast Trend-Line for COVID - 19?
6. Find the Highest Death rates in International Level.
7. Find the Least Death rates.
8. Can we find the variation in COVID - 19 Cases around the World.
9. Can we forecast the sheet for future and reference.

## Conclusion

This analysis of the COVID-19 dataset provided valuable insights into the pandemic's impact across different nations. Countries with higher population densities and international connectivity reported significantly higher confirmed cases, while recovery rates varied depending on healthcare systems and response measures. A focused analysis of India highlighted the nationâ€™s management efforts in controlling the outbreak. Trend forecasting using predictive models offered a glimpse into potential future cases, supporting resource planning and public health strategies. Additionally, identifying countries with the highest and lowest death rates emphasized the role of healthcare infrastructure in managing mortality. The observed global variation in cases underscored the importance of timely interventions, healthcare accessibility, and vaccination campaigns. Overall, this analysis serves as a useful resource for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to make informed decisions and prepare for future challenges.
